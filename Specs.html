                <p class="center b-para">Phone 12 Pro smartphone was launched on 13th October 2020. The phone comes with a 6.10-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1170x2532 pixels at a pixel density of 460 pixels per inch (ppi). The iPhone 12 Pro supports wireless
                    charging, as well as proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the iPhone 12 Pro on the rear packs a 12-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.6 aperture; a second 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.4 aperture and
                    a third 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.0 aperture. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 12-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.2 aperture.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Samsung Note 20 Ultra</h2>
                <p class="center b-para">The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G is extremely expensive but offers the best of Samsung's technology including a 108-megapixel camera, 5x optical zoom, and an enhanced S-Pen stylus. You get a huge 6.9-inch QHD+ Amoled screen that can
                    run at 120Hz (but not at the same time as the QHD+ resolution). Build quality is very good but the huge camera bump is a bit inconvenient. The Exynos 990 processor is very good, but not as powerful as the Snapdragon 865+ that powers
                    international versions of this phone.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Oneplus 8 Pro</h2>
                <p class="center b-para">The OnePlus 8 Pro has a similar design as the OnePlus 8 but with some subtle changes. Its display is actually rounded on the sides, rather than just having curved glass like on the 8. It has a pretty big 6.78-inch QHD+ (1440x3168-pixel)
                    AMOLED panel, with a claimed high colour accuracy and HDR10+ support. New this year is the 120Hz refresh rate. The display is vibrant, colourful, and bright.</p>
